# Angular boilerplate for FiveM ([itschip/react-fivem-lua-boilerplate](https://github.com/itschip/react-fivem-lua-boilerplate) rewrite for Angular)

After applying to work on NoPixel I decided it was kinda silly to have zero FiveM related projects on my GitHub. Put this project together last night so that I will have SOMETHING. Its not complete, but with limited time its a decent start. Will add doc next. /me sleeps
